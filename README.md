Welcome! I am a Pharmaceutical Sciences graduate making a transition into data analytics and actively pursuing junior or apprenticeship roles. With a deep foundation in scientific research and quantitative reasoning, Iâ€™ve recently earned the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, gaining hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and reporting using tools like SQL, R, and Excel.

My academic background equips me with strong attention to detail, analytical thinking, and the ability to interpret complex datasetsâ€”skills. Through personal projects and coursework, Iâ€™m honing proficiency in:

Data wrangling and cleaning (Excel, SQL)

Exploratory data analysis and visualization (Google Sheets, Tableau, R/Python)

Reporting and storytelling, translating raw data into clear recommendations

This code repository contains practice SQL queries I've written. Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have any questions.
